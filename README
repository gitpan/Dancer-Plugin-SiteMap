Dancer-Plugin-SiteMap

Plugin module for the Dancer web framwork that automagically adds sitemap
routes to the webapp. Currently adds /sitemap and /sitemap.xml where the
former is a basic HTML list and the latter is an XML document of URLS.

Currently it only adds staticly defined routes for the GET method.

Using the module is literally that simple... 'use' it and your app will
have a site map.

The HTML site map list can be styled throught the CSS class 'sitemap'

Optionally, the omission list can be populated by way of the robots.txt file,
both the HTML and XML sitemap URLs can be customised (or omitted) and a custom
HTML sitemap template can be specified.
